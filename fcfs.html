    <h1>FIFO Page Replacement Algorithm</h1>
    <h2>What are Replacement Algorithms?</h2>
    <p>Generally, most operating systems use the method of paging for memory management. These algorithms are needed to
        make a
        decision of which page needs to be replaced when a new page comes into the picture or is demanded.

        The need for the demand occurs when the Operating Systems need any page for the processing which is not actually
        present
        in the main memory. This situation is also called Page Fault.

        Page Fault: The page fault takes place when the main program accesses the memory page which is mapped into a
        virtual
        address space but is not loaded in physical memory.

        When the Physical Memory is much smaller than the Virtual Memory in such a situation Page Fault happens.</p>
    <h2>What is FIFO Page Replacement Algorithm</h2>
    <p>FIFO which is also called First In First Out is one of the types of Replacement Algorithms. This algorithm is
        used in a
        situation where an Operating system replaces an existing page with the help of memory by bringing a new page
        from the
        secondary memory.

        FIFO is the simplest among all algorithms which are responsible for maintaining all the pages in a queue for an
        operating system and also keeping track of all the pages in a queue.

        The older pages are kept in the front and the newer ones are kept at the end of the queue. Pages that are in the
        front
        are removed first and the pages which are demanded are added. <br>
        Beladyâ€™s anomaly proves that it is possible to have more page faults when increasing the number of page frames
        while
        using the First in First Out (FIFO) page replacement algorithm.</p>
    <h2>Advantages of FIFO</h2>
    <p>-FIFO is more efficient because it allows for data to be organized in chronological. <br>
        -FIFO is more efficient because it allows for data to be organized in itemized order. <br>
        -FIFO is more efficient because it can be marketed to businesses because it is easy to use.</p>
    <h2>FIFO Page Replacement Algorithm</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1. Start traversing the pages</li>
        <li>2. Now declare the size w.r.t length of the Page. </li>
        <li>3. Check need of the replacement from the page to memory.</li>
        <li>4. Similarly, Check the need of the replacement from the old page to new page in memory.</li>
        <li>5. Now form the queue to hold all pages.</li>
        <li>6. Now form the queue to hold all pages.</li>
        <li>7. Check bad replacemets and page faults.</li>
        <li>8. Get no of processes to be inserted.</li>
        <li>9. Show the values.</li>
        <li>10. Stop</li>
    </ul>
